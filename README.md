Fluffernut

Sure! Here's a starting point for a flexible, expandable AI companion named Fluffernut. The core idea here is to design a framework where users can easily add new features and functionality without altering the main structure. The code will be modular and encourage further development.

We'll build it in Python, and use a command-based interface to allow users to interact with Fluffernut. Users will also be able to extend it with new commands or plugins.

Fluffernut is your personal Web3 AI assistant, designed to help you with everything from crypto transactions to social media management. Whether you're managing tokens on Base or Solana, engaging on Twitter, or researching blockchain topics, Hiero's got you covered.

Core System:

The Fluffernut class handles user interaction and execution of commands.
Commands are registered via register_command(), and executed with execute_command().
The run() method starts a simple text-based shell that listens for commands.
Plugin System:

Plugins are functions that, when loaded, register additional commands.
In this example, weâ€™ve loaded two plugins: math_plugin and greeting_plugin.
User Interaction:

The user can enter commands (e.g., add 5 3, greet John, help).
Fluffernut responds with the appropriate output or error message.
The user can type exit to quit.
Adding New Features:

To add new functionality, users can create their own plugins (functions) that register commands with register_command.
Each plugin can provide any type of functionality, from calculations to data manipulation, games, and more.

Final Thoughts
Expandable: This framework allows users to expand Fluffernut by writing plugins. They can create any functionality by defining new commands and adding them to the system.
Interactive and User-Friendly: The simple shell interface makes it easy for users to interact with the AI and get results instantly.
Future Enhancements: Users can keep building by adding more sophisticated command processing, natural language understanding, API integrations, and more.
This is a basic skeleton of your AI companion that will grow with user contributions. It is a great starting point to keep evolving Fluffernut!
